A simple API, built for humans wishing to develop with Plone.

The intention is

* to cover 20% of the tasks any Plone developer does 80% of the time,
* to provide clear API methods for Plone functionality which may be confusing or difficult to access,
* keeping everything in one place,
* staying introspectable and discoverable, important aspects of being Pythonic.


Documentation
=============

`plone.api documentation <http://docs.plone.org/external/plone.api/docs/contribute/index.html>`_ is part of the official plone documentation.

``plone.api`` comes with *cookbook*-like documentation and step-by-step instructions for doing common development tasks in Plone.
Recipes try to assume the user does not have extensive knowledge about Plone internals.
